# Credit-Scorecard-Modelling

### Building a credit scorecard is a very typical industry-level problem, such as

* evaluating a transaction or customer’s credibility to perform further actions such as issuing a credit card or giving a balance transfer offer for high-credit customers in a credit card company
* giving promotions or premium rights to high-value customers in an e-commerce platform
* providing good customer segmentation to reach the right people in a marketing firm.
